<p>7Layers Exhibition</p>
<p>In 2025, Budapest Pride celebrated its 30th anniversary – and to mark this special milestone, six artists and one collective had come together to created the 7Layers exhibition.</p>
<p>The title 7Layers refers to the layers of human skin – the body’s largest and most expressive organ, offering both physical protection and a powerful tool for sensation and communication.</p>
<p>Just like the nerve endings in our skin absorb countless stimuli from the world, the artists soak in the impulses around them and express them through their creations.</p>
<p>Through diverse interpretations, the artists placed the human body at the center – turning the exhibition space into a shared "skin surface," where experiences and emotions met.</p>
<p>7Layers was not only an artistic exploration of the body and perception, but also a collective act of visibility: our goal is to shine a light on the work of queer artists and creators who explore themes of sexuality.  </p>
<p>We were grateful to have brought this project to life as part of the official program of the Budapest Pride Festival.</p>
<p>Exhibited Artists:<br>
Lilac 007, Lamm Lenke, Mérey Máté, Szalay Csenge, Szarka Dániel, Fánka, and the BLISS collective: Pálfi Lujza, Parlagi Róza, Kaposvári Zsófi, and Bodócs Szelina.</p>

<p>Rewritten Label Ring Collection</p>
<p>material: silver or bronze</p>
<p>year: 2025</p>
<p>This ring series was born out of a very real experience that many of us in the community face daily: the oversimplified, insulting labels that are slapped on us.
The initial idea was to create classic-shaped rings featuring the phrase “hülye buzi” = "stupid fag," but I later changed it to "huje buzi" which is a strong typo and often seen online.</p>
<p>On the jewelry, I deliberately hammered and distorted the word "huje" and replaced it with new, dignified descriptors that were punctured into the piece. These are terms that are rarely, if ever, used in public discourse regarding gay people: “smart,” “patriot,” “religious” and many others.
With these rings, I wanted to express two things. First: rewriting the narrow and distorted image that’s often painted of us. Second: reclaiming the word "buzi" a word that’s been used against us countless times. For me, this whole process is an act of self-definition, declaring who we are, based on our own terms, not others’ words.

<p>Rainbow Book Brooch - Protect Our Children from the Government Propaganda</p>
<p>year: 2024</p>
<p>material: powder coated aluminum, plastic wrap, brass, stainless steel</p>
<p>This brooch draws attention to the growing censorship faced by LGBTQ+ artists in Hungary. I see the so-called “plastic wrap” law as a symbolic moment; it restricts the open sale of queer-themed literature by mandating that such books be shrink-wrapped in stores.</p>
<p>The brooch shows that the rainbow-colored book still opens slightly beneath the suffocating plastic layer, resisting both oppression and control. The vibrant colors of the aluminum plates shine through the packaging, signaling that complete silencing is impossible.</p>
<p>Sadly, these kinds of restrictions often lead artists to self-censor or to leave the country altogether.</p>

<p>Coat of Arms Lobster Medal</p>
<p>year: 2025</p>
<p>material: brass, silver, wood, stainless steel</p>
<p>I imagined this piece as a fictional award, a playful yet meaningful tribute to LGBTQ+ individuals or allies who, through their bold public presence over the past year, have helped move acceptance forward in Hungary.</p>
<p>The medal features a lobster, proudly wearing a smaller silver lobster medal on its chest, a literal case of “object within the object.” I chose the lobster intentionally: it used to be a pejorative slang word for gay people in Hungarian, but here, I’m reclaiming and reshaping its meaning. This lobster now wears its “coat of arms” with pride and self-assurance, a bit ironic, but full of significance.</p>
<p>For me, this work is humorous, honest, and encourages a symbolic pat on the back for those who stand up for diversity, even when it’s not easy.</p>

<p>ELECTRO-VASES</p>
<p>course leaderS: Flóra VÁGI, Zoltán LUBLOY</p>
<p>year: 2025</p>
<p>material: eéectroformed copper</p>
<P>My first approach worked with the tension between used and unused surfaces of objects. Onto these quiet areas I grew electroformed copper guided by a coral-like doodle motif, a pattern that slowly spread and thickened through the process. The result was a series of vases where delicate, hand-drawn lines turned into solid metallic growths — fragile sketches becoming enduring structures. These pieces examined how absence can be activated and how overlooked details can gain new material presence.</P>

<p>course leader: Krisztián ÁDÁM</p>
<p>year: 2024</p>
<p>material: porcelain</p>
<p>model: Kincső Keglevich</p>
<p>Our final semester’s task was 
to design an award in a cli
ent-based situation with the 
participation of the Capital 
Circus of Budapest. I chose 
to design for the Newcomer 
Show Prize.</p>
<p> For this, I started my research 
along the keywords of tradi
tion, playfulness, and status. 
This led me to the classic, 
pointed clown hat as the main 
motif, an emblematic form that 
has accompanied circuses for 
centuries, from the commedia 
dell’arte troupes through Pi
errot to today’s white clowns. 
This way, passing on a hatful of 
tradition to young talents.</p>
<p>My material choice fell on por
celain due to its pure white ap
pearance, nobility, and ability 
to be mass-produced.</p>

    <p>ELECTRO-BOWLS</p>
<p>course leader: Zoltán TÓTH</p>
<p>year: 2023</p>
<p>material: copper</p>
<p> In our fifth semester, our task 
was to design a bowl, with the 
requirement of using metal 
as the central material. Once 
again, I embarked on an expe
riment, this time delving into 
the technique of electrofor
ming.</p>
<p>The essence of this technique 
lies in creating a thicker metal 
layer through electrolysis, eit
her as an independent object 
or as a coating. Historically, 
it was primarily used in prin
ting, and currently, it’s used 
for museum replicas. However, 
the crystalline, wild formations 
produced as a byproduct were 
considered undesirable in the 
industry and were concealed.</p>
<p> I aimed to showcase this dua
lity of objects created through 
this technique in my bowl set, 
drawing formal inspiration 
from 20th-century digital di
agrams depicting the effect of 
gravity on the space-time continuum.</p>

<p>QUAIL EGG SETTING</p>
<p>year: 2022</p>
<p>material:  silicone, paracord, quail eggshell</p>
<p>course leader: Zoltán TÓTH</p>
<p>model: Máté MÉREY</p>
<p> In this design task, we had to 
safely encase a blown qua
il egg in an alternative way in 
jewelry. In contrast to its small, 
fragile shell, I began to think 
about a flexible encasing layer, 
the final material of which be
came a dual-layer silicone.</p>
<p> In its formal design, I returned 
to the motif of the egg, crea
ting a turned-out, flipped-up 
caricature of it, tying a knot 
on its pinched „white” to make 
the jewelry wearable around 
the neck. The pattern form was 
turned from aluminum, from 
which the silicone pattern was 
created.</p>
<p> Due to the jewelry’s hollow and 
flexible nature, it can be stret
ched and fitted with a tool, 
allowing the delicate eggshell 
to be placed inside. Thus, the 
opening serves not only an 
aesthetic role, showcasing the 
internal content when worn, 
but also functions as a functi
onal aperture.</p>

<p>ALTERNATIVE SETTING</p>
<p>year: 2022</p>
<p>material: plywood, garnet, copper, brass</p>
<p>course leader: Zoltán TÓTH</p>
<p>model: Abel DUTOURNIER</p>
<p> Another design task of our se
mester was to create a novel 
setting for a traditional, face
ted gemstone.</p>
<p>For this, I chose wood as the 
base material, intrigued by its 
flexibility. I designed an elon
gated shape that, through 
wedging, would accommoda
te the stone snugly. To prevent 
breakage, laminated wood 
proved most suitable for the 
task. Pre-cutting the stone 
bed ensured its stability, and 
to prevent it from being pul
led out, I also equipped the 
ring with an additional copper 
strap.</p>
<p> Formally, I was inspired by the 
rounded nature of the stone’s 
cut and the central symmetry 
of its grip. By shifting the cle
avage in one direction, a more 
unified, gestural form emerges 
when viewed from the side.</p>

<p>material: steel, mineral orb</p>
<p>model: Kincső Keglevich</p>
<p> The craft task related to the se
mester also aimed at setting. 
Here, we had to design a ring 
with an alternative grip for a 
given shaped stone.</p>
<p> As a challenge, I aimed to 
create a tension jewelry pie
ce, for which I began using 
steel early on due to its flexi
bility and toughness. To split 
the hard steel wire ring that 
tensions around the spherical 
mineral, I personally made the 
hand-operated tool.</p>

<p>year: 2022</p>
<p>material:  mycelium-composite</p>
<p>course leader: Nóri TENGELY</p>
<p>model: Kincső KEGLEVICH</p>
<P> The design task of this se
mester was titled „Monolith” 
requiring our jewelry to be 
made from a continuous ma
terial. My goal was to experi
ment with materials, for which 
I found the mycelium compo
site to be a promising innova
tion.</P>
<P> Thematically, I aligned this ear
ring with Stella McCartney’s 
Spring 2022 collection, which 
featured mushroom leather 
bags. For the basic appearan
ce, I chose the ear protector 
shape worn by water polo 
players, fitting with the breakt
hroughs seen in the collection, 
which add excitement to the 
visibility of the ear.</P>
<p> The material experiments yi
elded good results with the 
mushroom. Through multipart 
gypsum and wax growth for
ms, the jewelry pieces were 
fully formed.</p>

<p>Paper Bangle set</p>
<p>year: 2022</p>
<p>material: paper, yarn</p>
<p>course leader: András BÁNFALVI</p>
<p>This design task of the se
mester was the utilization of 
paper at the level of jewelry. 
In this, I found the layering of 
various qualities of paper to 
be an exciting challenge. The 
rhythmic alternation of crepe, 
photo cardboard, and tracing 
paper resulted in dynamic stri
ping.</p>
<p> The papers were fastened 
together using bookbinding 
techniques, evoking the mood 
of Japanese notebooks. To en
hance the concept’s dynam
ism, some jewelry pieces fea
tured red-and-white binding 
thread.</p>
<p>After finding the baseline and 
establishing a regular system, 
I expanded the work towards 
more chaotic arrangements 
to explore the widest palette 
possible. In the latter, emotio
nal expression began to emer
ge, serving as a therapeutic 
approach to stress manage
ment.</p>

<p>Our admission to university 
began with our first summer 
camp, during which we famili
arized ourselves with the tech
nique of bronze casting in a 
task named „Structure”. Using 
wax sheets and rod materials, 
we were tasked with creating 
a structure, preparing it for 
casting, pouring it on-site, and 
then refining it later in the se
mester.</p>
<p> I aimed to create a freely trea

<p>SMOKEY-PUFFBALL</p>
<p>course leaders: Krisztián ÁDÁM, Péter ORR</p>
<p>creation: 2022</p>
<p> In the elective course of the 
second semester, under the 
title „Body of Smoke,” we were 
tasked with creating a plastic 
object with an incense holder 
function. We had to choose 
some form of vitality as our 
inspirational basis.</p>
<p> I drew inspiration from the 
shapes of puffball mushrooms, 
as their spore dispersal is very 
similar to the movement of 
smoke, thus creating a fitting 
combination. To achieve this, I 
poured plaster into flexible tu
bes and manipulated them un
til I obtained the desired form.</p>
<p> During our usual summer 
camp in Mezőtúr, the object 
was cast. For this, I needed to 
build an internal inlet system 
to preserve the natural surface 
of the casting outside.</p>

<p>ENDLESS RUST KNOT</p>
 <p>course leader: Nils HINT</p>
 <p>year:2023</p>
 <p> I created this object during our 
foundry course called „Malmi
valu” in Tallinn. The technique 
used was a special foam cast
ing method, where I made a 
knotted form out of styrofoam. 
After creating sprues, I molded 
it in sand, and as the molten 
iron flows in, it burns away the 
foam form, taking its place.</p>
<p> The idea of knotting comes 
from my childhood, where the 
four-square braid is its name, 
which I usually used for my zip
pers and other items.</p>
<p>The knot itself is a symbol of 
infinity, intertwining into itself, 
forever standing unbreakable. 
The rusting, as a surface treat
ment, symbolizes the factor of 
time in the context, questio
ning the eternity of the sculp
ture’s afterlife.</p>

<p> This smaller sculpture was also 
created during the Malmiva
lu foundry course, using wax 
casting.</p>
<p> My playful concept encom
passed an object that, like the 
„Jack-in-the-box,” always re
turns to its original position. 
The base shape was a sphere, 
from which I carved out the 
hollow object with a heavier 
bottom. To further enhance 
the playful aspect, I also made 
a conical rod with a strong 
magnet inserted into it, al
lowing the rocking sculpture 
to be pulled out of its initial 
position.</p>
